## Dynamic features/interactables
There's a start menu when you begin the game that allows the player to select which city will be used, as of now the only city is Lubbock. Whenever you click a well from within the game, it will display the information about each well. Also there is a User Interface which allows the player to cycle between cameras(Main, Elevation, and Aerial) by clicking each button respectively.

- Chose the terrain and exported the terrain from the high map 
- Created the rain effect and cloud effect by using particle systems
- Created a water fountain by using particle system
- Created two buttons called "pause" and "play" to activate the rain and stop the rain
- Wrote scripts to let buttons control the rain audio
- Found out the monthly precipitation data in Lubbock and recorded the data in an excel document
- Read data from the excel document and calculate the average precipitation data for each season.
- Created the water layer and set the water thickness by using the average precipitation data for each season
